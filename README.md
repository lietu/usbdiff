# usbdiff

Monitors for changes in your USB devices, disconnects and connects, and shows them in a convenient output format.

For a graphical version check out [usbdiff-gui](https://github.com/lietu/usbdiff-gui).

Depends on `lsusb`, `diff`, and `bash`, this means it likely only supports Linux.

Once you clone this repository or otherwise download the `usbdiff` -script, you should be able to run it.

Usage:

```bash
chmod +x usbdiff
./usbdiff
```
